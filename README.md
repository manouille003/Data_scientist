# Data_scientist

For the fourth day exercising Ruby programmation, we were asked to perform array organization and data games.

You will find in 00_journalists.rb a list of existing Twitter login names, organized in array, with different directives with results.
Questions are in french language but you can understand the result.

In 01_cryptocurrencies.rb, you will find a excercice mixing two arrays and their respective data.
I hope to be finished with this one before late hours.

Enjoy !!
